```

## Preparing data for predicting RankingPoints with lagged variables of previous 25 weeks RankingPoints (half year)

The list of features created for each golfer/week pair (with its respective RankingPoints) to train a model and predict the RankingPoints of golfers in future tournaments are:

- A: 1 feature with the mean of the best 5 RankingPoints (all time)

- B: 1 feature with the mean of the worst 5 RankingPoints (all time)

- C: 25 features with the RankingPoints of the previous 25 weeks (lagged variables)

- D: 1 feature with the variance of these 25 lagged features or previous RankingPoints (without considering missings or weeks without competing)

- E: 25 features with the RankingPoints of the previous 25 weeks but binned (e.g. instead of RankingPoints=66 now RankingPoints="(5,100]") using the limits or breaks [0,1,2,5,100]

- F: 5 features with the mean of RankingPoints by groups of 5 previous weeks (without considering missings or weeks without competing)

  golfer <- data$GolferID[row]
  week <- data$Week[row]
  event_id <- data$EventID[row]

```

## Resume of features

```{r}
ids <- c("GolferID","Week","EventID")
target <- "RankingPoints"
features <- names(data_preprocessed)[!(names(data_preprocessed) %in% c(ids,target))]
```

## Loading trained model in Azure ML Studio (.zip file as "Script Bundle (Zip)" input)

```{r}
library(xgboost)
change_desired_model_file_name_here <- "Model best MSE with all data.model"
model <- xgb.load(paste0("./src/", change_desired_model_file_name_here))
```

## Predictions of target week

```{r}
test_xgbDMatrix <- xgb.DMatrix(data=data.matrix(data_preprocessed[,features]))
data_preprocessed[,target] <- predict(model, test_xgbDMatrix)
```

## Output Azure ML Studio

```{r}
output <- data_preprocessed[,c(ids,target)]
maml.mapOutputPort("output")
```
