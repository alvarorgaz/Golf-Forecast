**Abstract:** 

This repository contains a project that I have developed for a private startup dedicated to golf forescasting for betting. The objective is to create a predictive model for forecasting the position of golfers in future tournaments based only on the historical information sent by the company. The data contains 170k observations with the following features:

- GolferID: anonymised identification of the golfers

- Week: the week number being 1 the most recent one

- RankingPoints: total ranking points got by the golfers in this week/tournament

Moreover, I have designed an experiment in Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio for deploying the locally trained models (and the necessary preprocessing code for new data) into the startup website.

**Code:**

The project has been developed in R and using parallel computation.
